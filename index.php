<?php echo 
'<h1>Hello World!

Distance Student, Landenberg, PA</h1>
<br/>Added semi colon to php statement :P
<br/>PHP *still* not working but works locally. Adding external html tags, sigh.
<br/>Enough. Removing PHP.
<br/>Adding PHP back in; apparently Git changed the permissions on index.php to 664; 
needs to be 644.'; ?>
