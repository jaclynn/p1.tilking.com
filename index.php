<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi everyone. My name is Jacqueline Wilson and I live in a small, old farmhouse in Landenberg, PA with my husband, son, two dogs and five cats. I work at my son's school as a technology director. I started HES in Spring 2011 with Len Evenchik's Communication and Internet Protocols course and loved it. I've since changed status to degree candidate, and I have five classes to go. I graduated high school (a long time ago) in Taipei, Taiwan. I have a computer science degree from University of Delaware. I use a Macbook Pro because it's the only machine that gives me access to all three operating systems I need to support. Plus, I hate Windows 8. </p>
